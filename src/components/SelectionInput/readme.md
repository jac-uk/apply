This folder contains components used by the original working preferences solution.
`SelectionInput` now seems a strange name!

The replacement solution for working preferences uses a new folder of `QuestionInput` components (perhaps also could be better named).

We have added a new `SelectionView` component (`SelectionInput/View`) which helps to reuse some of the original code and make it easier to support both the original and replacement solutions.
